I had taken over maintenance of the Twine package on the AUR, but will disown it as of this update due to limited reliable access to a machine running Arch. Hopefully I'll come back to it in the near-ish future! But for now, this is what I've got.

The current title of the AUR package is "twinejs-standalone."
