# twine-AUR
A repo for the Twine package in the Arch User Repository

I've taken over maintenance of the Twine package on the AUR and will track changes and versions here.

The current title of the AUR package is "twinejs-standalone." As I make my first commits to bring the package up to date with the current Twine version (2.2.1), I am using the previous maintainer's build and sources.

In the future I will likely make some changes to the PKGBUILD as I clarify dependencies and such - I'm very open to suggestions about the best way to package this. It's my first package - all helpful input is welcome!
