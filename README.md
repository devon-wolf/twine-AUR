I've taken over maintenance of the Twine package on the AUR and will track changes and versions here.

The current title of the AUR package is "twinejs-standalone." Please feel free to alert me to any issues, either here or as a comment on the AUR. I plan on keeping the previous maintainer's PKGBUILD as a base until there's a new Twine release.
